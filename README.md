# My Coding Challenges

Welcome to my coding challenges repository! This is a collection of programming problems I've solved to practice and improve my skills in Python, JavaScript, and SQL. Each solution is part of my learning journey, and I'm open to feedback to enhance my code.

## Structure
- **/python/**: Solutions to problems in Python.
- **/javascript/**: Solutions to problems in JavaScript.
- **/sql/**: Solutions to database-related problems in SQL.
- Each folder contains subdirectories for individual problems, with a solution file and a README explaining the problem and approach.

## Purpose
This repository showcases my problem-solving skills, coding logic, and growth as a developer. It’s a work in progress, and I’m constantly refining my solutions.

Feel free to explore and share your suggestions!
