# Problem 5: Max Consecutive Repeats

## Problem
Given a list of integers, find the maximum number of consecutive times any single number appears in the list.

## Solution
- **File**: solution.py
- **Approach**: Handled edge cases (empty list, single element), tracked current and max consecutive counts, compared each number with the previous, and updated the max count as needed.
- **Key Concepts**: Lists, iteration, conditionals, tracking variables.

## Example
- **Input**: `[1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 2, 1, 1]`
- **Output**: `3`
