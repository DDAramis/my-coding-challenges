# Problem 3: Filter and Square Positives

## Problem
Given a list of numbers, return a new list containing the squares of only the positive numbers. Ignore zeros and negative numbers.

## Solution
- **File**: FilterAndSquare.py
- **Approach**: Iterated through the list, filtered positive numbers using a condition, calculated their squares, and stored results in a new list.
- **Key Concepts**: Lists, conditionals, iteration, basic arithmetic.

## Example
- **Input**: `[-2, 0, 3, -1, 4, 5]`
- **Output**: `[9, 16, 25]`
