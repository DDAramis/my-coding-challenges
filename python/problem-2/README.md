## Solution
- **File**: solution.py
- **Approach**: Iterated through the list, checked if each number is odd using the modulo operator, double odd numbers kept even numbers unchanged, and stored results in a new list.
- **Key Concepts**: Lists, conditionals, iterantion, basic arithmetic.

## Example 
- **Input**: ´[1, 2, 3 , 4, 5, 6, 7]´
- **Output**:  ´[2, 2, 6 , 4 , 10, 6, 14]´
